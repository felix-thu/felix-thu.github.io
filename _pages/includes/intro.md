I am currently working on world models for robotics research and taking a gap year to pursue Ph.D. opportunities. If you find my background suitable for your research group, please feel free to contact me at [longxhe@gmail.com](longxhe@gmail.com).

My research primarily focuses on reinforcement learning, generative model, and optimization theory, currently, I am interested in 
1. GenAI for RL: Leveraging diffusion models to enhance RL performance.
2. Robust RL: Designing policies resilient to corrupted data or adversarial environments.
3. RL+X: Unlocking the potential of RL in other fields or using X to improve RL.
   
Specifically, I am interested in developing practically efficient algorithms with theoretical justification for fundamental machine learning problems.

I received my master’s degree from Tsinghua University in June 2025, where I was advised by Prof. [Xueqian Wang (王学谦)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h9dN_ykAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) in the Artificial Intelligence Program at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School. I also work closely with Prof. [Li shen (沈力)](https://sites.google.com/site/mathshenli/home).
